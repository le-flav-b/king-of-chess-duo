A damn file structure, a king  who can check himself and therefore you have to eat to win, a pawn that can only move back one square once it reaches the last line, and an optimization to burn retinas: I introduce you *King of Chess Duo* ! (I'm really proud of this name )
More seriously, I'm really proud of this project cause It was my biggest, and exept the flaws mentioned above, everything works perfectly !
And above all, I did this alone with basically no knowledge of pygame (with just a little help from a classmate to design the parts).
And There you go, in terms of functionality, I have only reinvented the wheel, so nothing really new.. Just a few sounds that are inconsistent but funny !
